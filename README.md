CSE214-HW5 Runs "a FXComponentTree which will serve as the tree manager and holds references into a tree (the root and cursor), as well as be able to generate and save the tree to and from a file. Again, defining some custom exceptions may be helpful for code readability."

CSE214-HW6 Runs a CourseNameComparator that allows us to compare two course names with the following priority: department and then number. The CourseNameComparator class also implements the Comparator interface and override the compare method. Funcitionality includes save states and preloaded files, and add/drop class, and view system of user (as a student) sorted via the course or semester.
